
In this project, a simple database application was developed using Python and SQLite. The schema structure of the database was designed by creating an Entity/Relationship diagram and translating it into SQLite tables using SQLiteStudio. The tables were then populated for testing purposes. Queries on the tables were designed and written in SQL using SQLite with Python. A graphical user interface (GUI) in Python was designed using PySimpleGUI. Finally, the tables and queries were connected together in a menu system using these GUIs, allowing users to manipulate data in the tables and execute meaningful queries.
